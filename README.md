# Meteor Profile

---

**This package is deprecated.** We will fix bugs, but will neither add new
features nor ensure future Meteor compatibility.  This package is just a thin
wrapper around the
[`simple-form`](https://atmospherejs.com/joshowens/simple-form) package.
Everything that this package is capable of can now be accomplished using
`simple-form` and your own templates, which is probably what you were going to
do anyway.  Thanks for using `profile`.

`/profile` interface to Meteor.user().profile
